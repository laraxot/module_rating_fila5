# Rating: resolve git conflict markers

**BMAD phase:** Dev (conflict resolution, verification)
**Owner module:** Rating
**Scope:** four PHP files that still contained `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>` markers.

## Context

The Rating module repository is in the middle of a merge (`.git/MERGE_HEAD` points to `fb4ae9db`, the index holds unmerged entries). This story only resolves the marker blocks in the working tree. It does not stage, commit or complete the merge.

Note: `HEAD` of `app/Filament/Tables/Columns/RatingsColumn.php` already contains markers. The file was committed in that state.

## Per-file decisions

### app/Models/Traits/HasRatingsTrait.php

- Both sides were compared after normalising style with Pint. Code lines are identical. Comment lines are identical. The only real difference is the `RuntimeException` import: `HEAD` keeps `use RuntimeException;`, the incoming side writes `\RuntimeException`.
- Decision: the file is restored to the `HEAD` (ours) version. It is the version that passes the project Pint configuration. The incoming side differs only in formatting (Yoda comparisons, `new X()` parentheses, phpdoc spacing), which Pint rejects.
- Behaviour is unchanged.

### app/Filament/Tables/Columns/RatingsColumn.php

- The marker blocks contained a duplicated cast, `return (string) (string) trans(...)`, followed by a second `return` on the other side. The first return was unreachable.
- Decision: one `return trans(...)` per branch, without a cast. Repository precedent is mostly bare `return trans(` (44 occurrences in Modules/*/app versus 7 with `(string)`).
- A peer session resolved the same blocks at 09:26 with this decision, while this story held the lock. The file was then formatted with Pint. Pint changed style only: a Yoda comparison in `isRated()`, and the docblock references `RatingsSection` and `HasRatingValuesFilter` became imports.

### tests/Unit/HasRatingsTraitAccessorsTest.php

- The file imports `use Mockery;`, so the bare `Mockery::mock(HasMany::class)` form was kept. The `\Mockery::mock` form was dropped.

### tests/Unit/HasRatingsTraitFormDataTest.php

- The side with constructor parentheses (`new RatingMorph()`, `new EloquentCollection()`) was kept. Pint enforces it (`new_with_parentheses`). Phpdoc alignment was fixed by Pint.

## Verification

| Check | Command | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Syntax, four files | `php -l <file>` | No syntax errors detected (all four) |
| Style | `./vendor/bin/pint --test --config pint.json <file>` | passed (all four, after Pint formatting) |
| Pest, trait and accessor tests | `./vendor/bin/pest Modules/Rating/tests/Unit/HasRatingsTraitAccessorsTest.php Modules/Rating/tests/Unit/HasRatingsTraitFormDataTest.php Modules/Rating/tests/Unit/HasRatingsTraitMorphTypesTest.php` | BLOCKED: 35 failed, 0 assertions. Every failure is `Class "PHPStan\PhpDocParser\Parser\TypeParser" not found`. The package `phpstan/phpdoc-parser` is missing from `laravel/vendor`. |

The Pest result is an environment failure and not a test verdict. The tests have not run. Restoring the vendor package (`composer install` from `composer.lock`) is needed before these tests can prove anything. That step was not taken here, because it changes the shared vendor tree.

## Open items

- Run Pest after the vendor package is restored, then rerun `./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse` (module wrapper) with cleared result cache.
- Finish or abort the in-progress merge in the Rating repository. Stage and commit only after review.
